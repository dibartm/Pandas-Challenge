# Pandas-Challenge
# This assignment requires you to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to create a report that includes data from various school performance metrics. The report should include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

### The first part of the assignment requires you to create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, such as total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, % passing math and reading, and % overall passing.

### The next part of the assignment involves summarizing key metrics for each school, such as school name, school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and % passing math, reading, and overall.

### You will also need to sort the schools by % overall passing to find the highest-performing and lowest-performing schools, and create DataFrames for both.

### Additionally, you need to create DataFrames that list the average math and reading scores for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school, and tables that break down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student), school size, and school type.

### Finally, you need to create a written report that includes at least two observable trends based on the data.
